YO what's up guys. Make sure you have Django and Python installed before trying to do anything with this repo.
Once you have that done, clone this directory, open Terminal and navigate to the directory on your computer.
THEN, type
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
Check the website out at url: "localhost:8000" in a web browser. Go to "localhost:8000/admin" and login with
username: projectEnergy
password: projectEnergy

You can play around with the data models we have, you can add some instances. Woohooooooo.
